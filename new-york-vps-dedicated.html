<h2><strong>Faster Transfer Speeds</strong></h2>
<p>High transfer speeds offer several distinct advantages, the primary one being faster file download and upload times. Sitting idle while waiting for files to complete their download or upload can be infuriating when other tasks need your attention at the same time.</p>
<p>Faster transfer speeds also enable you to more effectively work with large, high resolution files - an advantage particularly beneficial to photographers, videographers and creative professionals who often need to quickly transfer large volumes of information around their systems.</p>
<p>Not only will a higher port speed enable faster download and upload speeds, it may also help eliminate or at least diminish lag caused by networks; with reliable connections and increased processing power on your computer this problem may be resolved altogether.</p>
<p>If your business requires extensive data processing and transfer, 10 Gbps network connections are ideal. These servers offer lightning-fast connections that enable large chunks of information to be transferred in seconds - especially important when handling big data analytics such as Big Table; many data sets can reach terabytes making traditional servers unsuitable - 10Gbps servers allow quick backup and restore functionality while offering secure transfer times for storage purposes.</p>
<h2><strong>Increased Speed</strong></h2>
<p>Businesses reliant on website and application performance require high bandwidth connections for optimal website and application speed.
